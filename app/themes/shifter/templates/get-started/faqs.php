            How much does Shifter cost?

          <div class="faq__content">
            <p>Shifter hosting costs are minimal. Since static files are small and do not require computing, storage fees are less expensive. These price benefits get passed on to you, the consumer.</p>

            Is Shifter also a hosting service?

            <p>Yes! Shifter is both a WordPress static site generator and a hosting solution. We host the files that Shifter creates and allows you to connect custom domains. We do not, however, offer domain registration at this time.</p>

            How is Shifter managed?

            <p>Shifter has itâ€™s own admin menu separate from WordPress that gives you control of the site. You can turn WordPress on and off, converting to and from a static site. You can manage domain settings, multiple websites, and more.</p>

            How does Shifter change the typical WordPress experience?

          <div class="faq__content">
            <p>Shifter makes no changes to the standard management and administration workflow of WordPress. The WordPress dashboard remains the same, allowing you to manage your themes, plugins, updates, and content as normal. You can still write your own custom plugins and themes.</p>
            <p>When your content is updated and your site is ready to launch, you use Shifter to compile a new version of the static site and automatically distribute your files worldwide. You can then switch back to WordPress, make content changes, and recompile with Shifter.</p>
